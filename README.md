# pydori
A Bandori-based Sonolus engine written in [Sonolus.py](https://sonolus.py.qwewqa.xyz/).

This project is intended to serve as an example Sonolus.py engine. It supports playing Bandori levels,
but it is not an exact replica of the original game and differs in both mechanics and visuals.

## Usage

### Setup
Install Sonolus.py via your preferred package manager.

pip:
```bash
pip install sonolus.py
```

uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

### Running
Build and run the dev server:
```bash
sonolus-py dev --[play|watch|preview|tutorial]
```
